### About me



Xuesong Zhou joined the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment at [Arizona State University](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2182101) in 2013. Previously, he was an associate professor at University of Utah.


Zhou’s research work focuses on **dynamic traffic assignment, traffic estimation and prediction, large-scale routing and rail scheduling**. He has been assisting the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to develop and provide technical support for large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment systems, for the past 10 years. He serves as an Associate Editor for Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies. He has published more than 30 papers related to dynamic traffic assignment and rail operations research in Transportation Research Part B, Transportation Research Part C, EJOR and IEEE Transactions on ITS. His paper on single-track train timetabling is one of top 10 mostly cited papers in Transportation Research Part B during the period of 2007-2013. He is the principle developer of open-source package DTALite, light-weight open-source traffic assignment/simulation engine and NEXTA, a traffic data visualization platform, which have been used by a number of transportation planning agencies, with more than 3000 downloads from the Google Code website.  


Zhou is the co-chair of the IEEE ITS Society Technical Committee on Traffic and Travel Management, co-vice chair for Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, Railway Applications Section (RAS). He also serves as the chair for the Network Equilibrium Modeling Subcommittee in TRB Committee on Transportation Network Modeling (ADB30). He is also the co-inventor of Key2SafeDriving technologies, which has been reported by more than 300 media outlets including New York Times, Wall Street Journal and National Public Radio.


Students advised by Zhou have won a number of awards: Jeffrey Taylor received the Council of University Transportation Centers Pikarsky Award-Science & Technology-MS, 2014, Tie Shi won the First Prize in Management Science in Railroad Applications Paper Contest, Institute for Operations Research and Management Science (INFORMS), 2014. Tao Xing, Kenneth Williams, Rohan Madtha, Daniel Van Tassell won Windows Mobile Award, Microsoft's Imagine Cup Student Technology Competition, 2009, out of 125 participating student teams in the U.S.
